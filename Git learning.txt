This is the learning about Git and Github:

1: Creating a new repository.

2: Naming the repository.

3: Creating a new file or uploading files in repository.

4: Commit is used for making changes and it is visible from initial commit to last updated change that is commit.

5: That is why Git or Github is called as version control system.

6: In history we can see what are all the history that gone through our project.

7: This is the final edit for my understanding.
